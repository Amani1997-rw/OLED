## Employee Inheritance Hierarchy Documentation

This documentation provides instructions on how to run the example code, a brief overview of the implemented inheritance hierarchy, and any additional information required for evaluation. This Employee Management System is designed to handle different employee roles, including managers, directors, salespersons, and interns. The system is implemented in Python with a modular structure:


### Inheritance Hierarchy

The following inheritance hierarchy is implemented in the code:

```python
Employee
├── Manager

```
## File Structure:
- **employee.py**: Defines the base class `Employee`.
- **manager.py**: Defines the derived class `Manager`.
- **director.py**: Defines the derived class `Director`.
- **salesperson.py**: Defines the derived class `SalesPerson`.
- **intern.py**: Defines the derived class `Intern`.
- **tester.py**: Module for example usage.
